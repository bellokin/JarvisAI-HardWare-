# Jarvis Hardware Integration

This repository contains the Arduino IDE code for the hardware integration component of the Jarvis Smart Home project. The firmware, written in Embedded C/C++, is responsible for controlling and monitoring household electrical devices (e.g., lights and switches) and communicating with the backend to enable real-time smart home automation.

## Overview

- **Purpose:**  
  Interface with household devices to relay commands and sensor data for smart home automation.

- **Features:**  
  - Real-time device control via hardware signals.
  - Data collection and monitoring of electrical parameters.
  - Integration with the Jarvis ecosystem for a seamless smart home experience.

## Requirements

- [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software)
- A compatible Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Uno, Mega, etc.)
- Basic electronic components as per your wiring and circuit design

## Setup & Usage

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/bellokin/JarvisAI-HardWare-.git
